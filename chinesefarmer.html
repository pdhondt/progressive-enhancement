    <h4>The story</h4>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
        <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <table>
        <caption>Table representing the farmer's philosophy.</caption>

            <th><strong class="good">Good</strong> or <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> ?</th>

        <tr>
            <td>Lose a horse</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Win more horses</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p><strong class="good">Good</strong> and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
